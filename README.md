To use it correctly, you will need atleest two file or one if it's a .gb (genbank) file
An anotation file (.csv) and your mitogenome file (.fasta) that contain only the full sequence of your mitogenome.

The anotation file and the mitogenome file will be paired together, so please make sure that they have the exact same name (Except the extension) and their name refer to the orgnasim they are sequencing as follows :
organism.csv (Anotation file)
organism.fasta (mitogenome file)

if you have a mitogenome sequenced in two part, please name it normaly, but followed by _number_indicating_the_part:
organism_1.csv
organism_1.fasta
organism_2.csv
organism_2.fasta

The name of the file will be used to name the sequence in the gene fasta file


if you are using .gb file, no worries, they will be automaticly rename correctly, you have also a stand alone rename tool in "tools" folder.

By default you need to put your list of paired file in the ressources/raw_data/ folder,
But feel free to edit the setting.py file to change the default location of your file.

Simply run the main.py file and let the magic do its work.

The csv file must be called "list_accessionID.csv" with atleest a column named "accessionID" that contain your accessionID.
The csv file should be at the same place as the genbankDownloader.
Simply execute the file by double clicking on it or by the command line
python genbankDownloader.py
